This is a super simple but very limited library for sending text and images to Discord webhooks using Rust. This primarily exists as a way for me to easily add this functionality to my personal projects without needing to copy/paste or link to it across files. Because of that, I do not intend to add this to crates.io, there are better projects out there that exist for other people to use them, I just like to diy things like this. If, however, you still want to use this as example code so you can avoid depending on those libraries for whatever reason, or for any other purpose, you are free to do so.
